![sun](Images/sun.gif)

## Description:
We are looking at the viability of personal solar cells placed on the roofs of homes in various cities across the United States, with a specific focus on the St. Louis.
Null Hypothisis:
Personal Solar Panels would have no benefit for personal use.

## DataSets:
* Google Project Sunroof CSV Files:
	* Projected power generated by roofs in searched aresas.
	* Projected CO2 offset.

* Open Weather Map API:
	* Cloudiness of searched areas.

* Power Consumption PDF:
	* Amount of electricty from Fossil Fuels, Nulcear Power, and Renewable energy by State.


## 3-5 Initial Research Questions:

* Are personal solar panels a benefit for homeowners?
	* What is the fincial benefit of solar power v. cost of intilation
		* Account for average cloud cover from Open Weather Maps.
	
* Does living in high denisty or low density housing make a difference?

* How does a community benefit from personal solar panels for homeowners?
	* How much carbon offset is provided by Solar Cells?
	* How much power is currently providec by Fossil Fuels
